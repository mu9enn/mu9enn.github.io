## About Me
I am a fourth-year undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Robotics Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).    

Currently, I am an undergraduate researcher at [UESTC HiLab](https://hilab.uestc.edu.cn/) under the guidance of [Prof. Guotai Wang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Z2sFN4EAAAAJ) and [Prof. Shaoting Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=oiBMWK4AAAAJ), where I focus on exploring **fairness in vision-language models (VLMs) for medical imaging.**

## Education
- **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**, Chengdu, China  
  **Bachelor of Robotics Engineering**, 2022 - 2026  
  GPA: 3.93/4.00 ‚Äî Rank: 2/43 (top 5%)

## Research Experience
### 1. Undergraduate Researcher: Fairness in Medical Vision-Language Models

  - First-authored paper accepted at **ISBI 2025**: Constructed a fully fair dataset spanning multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, age) to conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis of 4 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under 5 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods.  
  - One first-authored paper finished and to be submitted.
 
### 2. Visiting Student: Medical Image Analysis
- **[MedAILab, Westlake Universiy](https://medai.lab.westlake.edu.cn/)** | Mentor: Prof. Yefeng Zheng | 06/2025 - 08/2025  
  - Dedicated to studying the unimodel bias problem of medical multimodal large language model (MLLM) in Vision Question Answering (VQA) tasks.

### 3. Research Intern: Medical Image Analysis
- **NTU, Singapore** | Mentor: Dr. Teoh Teik Toe | 01/2024  
  - Contributed as a third author to a paper accepted by **ICPICS 2024**: Investigated the impact of Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention modules on ResNet variants for chest X-ray classification.
